            <p>Riverbond Rafting was founded in 2005 by outdoor enthusiasts and married couple, Sarah and Jake Brooke, inspired by their love for the rivers of Utah and a passion for sharing white water rafting adventures. Starting with a single raft, they aimed to provide safe, family-friendly experiences. By 2011, the company had expanded its fleet, hired experienced guides, and introduced popular packages for family reunions and corporate retreats. In 2016, they committed to environmental sustainability with eco-friendly practices and partnerships with local conservation organizations. Today, Riverbond Rafting is a leader in family-oriented rafting, known for its exceptional service, safety, and commitment to preserving natural waterways. Looking ahead, they plan to expand offerings with multi-day excursions and educational programs.</p>
